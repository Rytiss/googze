# Project is no longer under development #

**Userscript for showing aerial photos from Google Maps in Waze cartouche editor.**

**_Note_**: aerial imagery is only shown in places where original imagery (no matter what quality) already exists.

# Supported browsers #
  * Google Chrome
  * Mozilla Firefox _with Greasemonkey extension installed_

# Usage #

Download Googze. Browser will ask for it to be installed, agree. Visit waze.com go to Cartouche (map editor) and enable Aerial layer. Googze will replace Waze imagery with imagery from Google maps. When dragging the map, Waze imagery may show for a few seconds, but it will be replaced soon. If in doubt, refresh the editor.

# Special notes #

  * You cannot legally copy content from Google Maps to Waze. Therefore Googze may only be used for reference purposes.

  * _Google Chrome_ shows that extension will access data on all websites; this is only a default message, Googze will only work on waze.com.
